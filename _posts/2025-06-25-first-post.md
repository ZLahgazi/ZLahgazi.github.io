This is my first post on this website. Posts are made using .md Markdown files. It's quite straight forward to follow, for me atleast. My initial intention was to use this site as a place to upload images however I have since learnt that Github Pages, the free service I am using to host this website, has a limit of 1GB for all the website files. Perhaps in the future I'll look at alternative hosting services, but for now this will serve my needs.

Here are some photos of our recent trip to the Colchester Zoological Society (a fancy name for a zoo).
