I have a new job! I started at native, a startup that helps connect students to student unions to advertisers, as a graduate data scientist on the 11th of August. Becoming a data scientist has been a goal of mine since graduating, so I feel quite chuffed to be one big step closer. It is a hectic work environment, not your typical graduate role, but if I take full advantage of it there is so much I can learn and so much I can put my name on.

Other things that have happened, I went to my first Chelsea game. A friendly against Leverkusen on August the 8th. We won 2 nil. It was a surreal experience as someone who has been following the football club for nearly 10 years from the other side of the planet.

Joy and I have also been on great day trips to Brighton and Oxford. Brighton was such a fun vibe, and Oxford has a ridiculous amount of cool, historic buildings. We've been to a few museums too, with the Ashmoleon in Oxford being Joy's favourite, and the Victoria and Albert in London being mine.
