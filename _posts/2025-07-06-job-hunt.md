I have moved into a spaceous room with live in landlords at a really nice place in Kennington. I am enjoying being so central and I finally feel like I am living in London. I've applied for many jobs and I have had a handful of interviews, and even received an offer! I am very grateful to have found work relatively soon after arriving in the UK. It brings with it a positive feeling about the future. Today, I am going to a Drum and Bass festival called WAH in the City, just out by the London City Airport. It will be a great way to unwind and I've missed a good doof.

Here's some photos of random stuff around London.
