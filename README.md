# Zak's Website README

I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) to create this website, which is hosted using GitHub Pages. This repository was generated from the [Minimal Mistakes starter template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate). I only needed to buy the domain name (zaklahgazialaoui.com) and the rest was free.
