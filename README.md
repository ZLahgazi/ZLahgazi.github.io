# Zak's Website README

I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) to create this website, which is hosted using GitHub Pages. This repository was generated from the [Minimal Mistakes starter template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate). I only needed to buy the domain name (zaklahgazialaoui.com) and the rest was free.

## Adding images to posts

Compress images before adding them to blog posts to save on storage using [compressor.io](https://compressor.io/).

If an image is rotated incorrectly you can fix this with the following on MacOS:
1. Open the affected image in Finder using Preview
2. Use COMMAND + L or COMMAND + R to rotate the image as desired
3. Close Preview and the image will now be saved in the correct orientation.
