My name is Zakaria Lahgazi-Alaoui, but I pretty much only go by Zak. I am a 25 year old, born in the UK and raised in NZ. I am half Moroccan and half Kiwi.

This website is a place for me to showcase events in my personal and professional life. I aim to upload blog style posts and also photos that I take with my Fujifilm X-T30 II camera.
